                <p>If you have an item you would like to donate to the auction, it's not too late! Contact us at<a href="mailto:EAFAuction@alaskaair.com">EAFAuction@alaskaair.com</a>.</p>
                <p>1) <span>All items are donated.</span> (Our lawyers made us say this.) Sponsors are not responsible for the quality, condition, availability, description, etc. of the prizes. EAF and Alaska Air Group and its affiliates, expressly disclaim any and all warranties concerning auction items, and bidders agree to release EAF and Alaska Air Group and its affiliates from all claims or liability arising from their ownership or use. Buyer may need to contact donor directly to arrange shipping or make reservations. Donated items arriving after the beginning of the bidding period will be added to their respective categories.</p>
                <p>2) <span>Taxes</span> - Donated items are tax deductible. Purchased items are not tax deductible, except possibly any amount paid over and above the stated retail value, but that is between you and your tax expert, don’t take our word for it… see #3 below.</p>
                <p>3) <span>Who’s the Boss?</span> Auction sponsors are volunteers, we are not professional auctioneers! Sponsor decisions regarding final bid awards, winners, and functions of the auction are at the discretion of the sponsors. We will try to resolve problems quickly and fairly, but our decisions are final because We Are The Mom, and We Said So! We reserve the right to disqualify any bidder not participating in the spirit in which the auction is intended. Disputes will be settled using the information on the data base and the server clock.</p>
                <p>4) <span>Paying</span> - By registering and bidding, you agree to pay the bid amount. That is not a foreign concept!! Once a bid is posted, it cannot be removed, so don't bid stupid. You also agree to claim your item within the distribution period. We will begin awarding unclaimed items to the second-highest bidders two weeks after closing. NOTE: If you don’t pay for your items, you will not be allowed to play next year – you will sit in the corner on a Time-Out and watch everyone else play. Items can be picked up and payment made at the EAF offices in the Alaska Employees Federal Credit Union, 19530 International Blvd., #108, SeaTac, WA 98188. A schedule will be posted at the closing of the auction. We can accept major credit cards by phone or onsite – remember that credit card fees diminish the benefits to EAF. You can also transfer funds from your AFCU account into the EAF account to pay for items. Checks may be sent via comail (SEAEA), or US Postal Service to the address above. No prizes will be distributed until payment is received - no matter how nicely you ask. If you have questions about payments, contact auction sponsors at<a href="mailto:EAFAuction@alaskaair.com">EAFAuction@alaskaair.com</a></p>
                <p>5) <span>Location</span> - The physical location of the item and/or the service provider is noted on the auction page. If you cannot pick up the item or gift certificate yourself, we can arrange for it to be shipped or co-mailed to you - unless it is marked CANNOT BE SHIPPED. All shipping and insurance costs are the responsibility of the buyer, and must be prepaid before shipping. Transportation to the location of a hotel, attraction or service provider is the responsibility of the buyer.</p>
