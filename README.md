EAF-Auction
===========

The EAF auction raises money for the Alaska Airlines Employee Assistance Fund.  The current website lacks functionality and reliability that is needed by the EAF.  The EAF auction is live for two weeks beginning in Late October and ending in early November.  Inputting of items begins this spring and continues up until ~48 hours before the final closing.  Last year the website crashed due to traffic, trouble times include when all items open and when they are nearing closing.  Website traffic ramps up at peak times reaching over 900 server requests per minute. The 1500-1800 bidders rack up on average over 1 Million page hits during the two weeks.  Last year 2100 Items were posted, and 800 people won items. (Many bidders win multiple items)
